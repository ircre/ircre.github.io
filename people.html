            <p><strong>Gunnar Westin</strong>, Ph.D. 1995 and Docent 1998 at Stockholm University moved his group to
                Uppsala University during the year 2000 taking a Senior Lecturer position in Chemical nanotechnology. He
                became a Professor in the same area in 2006. He also held a part time position at ABB Corporate Research
                in 2002-2003, implementing solution processing. His research stretches from fundamental to applied and
                involves all steps of solution based materials synthesis; from design of molecular heterometallic
                alkoxide precursors, via solution processing, to studies of the target ceramic, composite and metallic
                materials. The focus is on complex composition and shape nanomaterials, such as thin films, ultra thin
                coatings, sponges and compacts with applications in renewable energy, electro-ceramics, multiferroics
                and hard materials.<br>
                Several of the invented processes have been up-scaled together with industry and one is applied globally
                in large scale; the superior hardness and toughness WC-Co composites used in mining, drilling and
                infrastructure excavation. Another example of up-scaling is the low cost roll-to-roll process for
                Ni-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite films with record high solar thermal absorption efficiency.<br>
                Westin pioneered the area of sol-gel processing in Sweden during his graduate student time, building a
                research laboratory and group from scratch after his own ideas. He has been the leader of a large number
                of academic and industry projects and executive board member and area manager of a competence centre.
                Westin has published 80+ journal papers, 7 patent families and given 175+ talks (Last 5 years; 40
                invited/keynote/tutorial talks at international conferences) He served as a member of the board of
                directors of the International Sol-Gel Society 2004-2009, is Editorial board member of Int. J.
                Nanotechnology, Composites B J. and Associate editor of Int. J. Nanoscience, and reviewer for 25+
                journals. He has co-/organised 20+ international conferences and served in review panels in Sweden and
                Europe and reviewed applications for grants and positions for a number of international Science
                organisations. </p>

            <p><strong>Ioannis Zegkinoglou</strong>, a condensed matter physicist with over 10 years of experience
                (Max-Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart, Germany; Univ. Wisconsin Madison, USA;
                Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA) in employing synchrotron-based x-ray scattering and
                spectroscopy techniques for the study of the structure and the electronic properties of a wide range of
                materials of both fundamental and application-oriented interest. Current research activities include the
                investigation of charge generation and separation processes at solid semiconductor / liquid electrolyte
                interfaces; in dye-sensitized oxide nanostructures; and at atomically abrupt semiconductor interfaces,
                for light harvesting (solar cell), solar water splitting (artificial photosynthesis) and environmental
                science applications. Core level soft x-ray spectroscopy techniques are primarily used for these
                studies, including x-ray absorption (NEXAFS), ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy (APPES) and
                time-resolved (pump-probe) x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TR-XPS). In-depth knowledge in the field of
                strongly correlated electron systems (high-temperature superconductors, magnetic oxides, orbital-ordered
                compounds) was previously obtained using hard x-ray scattering techniques, such as resonant x-ray
                diffraction, x-ray reflectometry and high-energy diffuse x-ray scattering.</p>
