In 1975, the department of Machinery Manufacture and parts of the department of Engineering Physics were merged and re-constructed into two new departments: Department of Energy &amp; Power Engineering and Department of Power Machinery Engineering. In April 1994, with the adjustment of Schools and Departments in Xi'an Jiaotong University, these two departments were merged and developed into the Energy &amp; Power Engineering School. In July of 2004, the main body of the School of Environmental and Chemical Engineering joined into the School of Energy &amp; Power Engineering and forms the present Energy &amp; Power Engineering School.</div></td>
