                            strengths of foreign and local PIs, visiting scientists and collaborators involved in this
                            application. The envisaged core competency will enable fruitful collaborations with
                            established other research institutes. IRCRE will act as an internationally competitive
                            platform to attract both young leaders through the established extended global network of
                            the directors and PIs as well as by collaborating with world renowned centers. The human
                            capital training and educational outreach will form an integral part of IRCRE, and will be
                            realized by fostering links to high-schools, structured graduate education, and fast-track

                            IRCRE strives to develop most effective methods for materials production and management
                            through cutting-edge interdisciplinary efforts. This would demand close interactions and
                            complementarities among scientists with different technical backgrounds and research
                            interests, which will be facilitated by the proposed center. In addition to the well-known
                            size-effects in nanoscopic matter, it is realistic to anticipate that increasing complexity
                            in nanostructures, for instance by creating nanoscale building blocks with two or more
                            components or by modifying their surface chemistry will offer new opportunities to bond (and
                            disbond), assemble and integrate them into new material systems. Chemical interactions
                            (electronic, steric, electrostatic, van der Waals, etc.) are the major source to code
                            information into molecular assemblies and nanostructures, for example, surface
                            functionalized inorganic nanoparticles can be selectively attached to a biomolecule or
                            organized into periodic arrays by tuning the surface chemistry of both nanostructure and the
                            substrate. Similarly, the intrinsic properties of discrete molecular species can be
                            preserved in a polymer matrix to create hybrid materials with novel optical, electronic and
                            catalytic activities. The development of advanced materials will serve the functional
                            assemblies and devices, and construction of renewable energy system. Thus, to meet the
                            demand for the development of renewable energy (especially solar and hydrogen) and related
                            energy materials, IRCRE will set up five research divisions. The key areas of the five

                            With the purpose to realize hydrogen production from renewable energy in an efficient, low
                            cost and pollution-free way, this division focuses on the following three aspects. 1)
                            Investigating the genetic nature of the degeneration effect of candidate bacteria in dark
                            fermentation using comparative genomic method, and then constructing engineering strain to
                            improve the conversion efficiency. 2) Studying on the hydrogen production pathway of PNS
                            (purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria) to knock out the genes that are not conducive to
                            hydrogen production and enhance gene expression that related with the target product. Thus,
                            the solar to chemistry energy conversion efficiency and hydrogen production can be improved.
                            3) Research on the degradation mechanism of aromatic compounds by the PNS will be carried
                            out. We are planning to construct safely engineered microorganisms that are able to

                            development of materials-based technologies by the fusion of chemical, materials, bio- and
                            nano-technologies. Chemical interactions at multiple length scales ranging from short range
                            intra- and intermolecular interactions to long range collective phenomenon in solids will
                            constitute the scientific foundation, and functional integration for renewable energy system
                            construction will constitute the engineering foundation of the proposed research center of
                            excellence Therefore, hierarchical integration of molecular and nanoscaled building blocks
                            into functional assemblies and devices, and construction of renewable energy system will
                            form the central tenet of IRCRE.<br/>
                            The center will be carried out within a 10-year period and completed by the creation of
                            spin-offs. It will be divided in two distinctive and consecutive phases. Phase I, which
                            comprises Year 1 to 5, will be dedicated to materials development and characterization.
                            Phase II, will consist of year 5-10 of the program and will be dedicated almost entirely on
                            the real-scale development and manufacturing, as well as packaging, assembly and testing of
                            the successful prototypes selected at the end of Phase I.

                            as the focal point for all IRCRE activities and coordinate, monitor and control the progress
                            of all projects. In addition, PMO will maintain accurate records of costs, resources and
                            time scales for the projects. Further, it will inform the IRCRE members about their rights
                            and obligations in intellectual property issues and will liaise with the administration to
                            develop a strategy to handle such cases. The role of the Directors includes harmonization of
                            technical aspects, maximization of synergies and mutual and effective exchange of
                            information within the center. The Principal Investigators will be responsible for the
                            technical objectives and outcome of the projects. They will ensure that project maintains
                            its relevance within the scope of IRCRE and agreed work plan. For scientific and strategic
                            planning a Scientific &amp; Industrial Advisory Board will be established. Leading members
                            from academia and industry, who will serve on this advisory board, have been contacted and
                            will guide IRCRE in planning the technical road-map to meet the long-term objectives.
                            National and overseas collaborators identified as project partners are listed above.
                            Additional collaborators will be invited, when additional expertise will be needed to
                            broaden the knowledge base and IRCRE network. Latter will be promoted by offering visiting
                            fellowships funded by the Director&rsquo;s funds. The proposed vertical integration of
                            fundamental research with nanoengineering will be realized by maintaining strong contact
                            with industrial partners, which would enable IRCRE technology platform to cater the need of
                            local and international industries.
