An important element of this reform is the new &ldquo;2+4+X&rdquo; model for research universities; a model which emphasizes providing the students with a solid foundation of general knowledge, sound research skills and the ability to innovate. The goal is to transform the university from one which simply transmits knowledge to one which emphasizes active engagement in research. In 2006, XJTU took the lead among Chinese universities when it undertook to create a system of residential colleges modeled on the traditional Chinese academy of learning. This twin college system is aimed at giving our students the best possible chance for success. In 2007, XJTU established the &ldquo;Qian Xuesen Experimental Class&rdquo; for particularly gifted students and the &ldquo;Zonglian Experimental Class&rdquo;, whose purpose is to develop an appropriate classroom model for medical education. The university also set up its &ldquo;engineering workshop&rdquo; to stimulate students&rsquo; interests in science and technology and to encourage innovation and creativity, in keeping with the adage that &ldquo;small inventions lead to big creations.&rdquo; In 2010, the university first Experimental Class for Talents of Basic Subject was started. As one of only two universities in China with a &ldquo;class for gifted young people,&rdquo; XJTU has received praise from students and parents alike for its unique educational model, its favorable study environment, excellent teachers and substantial teaching resources, and its positive good teaching results. So far, the university has received 60 national teaching awards. In addition, it currently has 34 national elite courses, 8 national–level teaching centers, and 9 national-level teaching teams. To date, 26 XJTU dissertations have been recipients of the annual award given to &ldquo;China's 100 best doctoral dissertations&rdquo;; another 40 have been nominated for that award.</span></div></td>
